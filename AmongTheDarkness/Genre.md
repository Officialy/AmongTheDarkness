### Genres           

Genres for this game would be the following:

Puzzle – My reasoning for this genre would be the fact the puzzles are required to complete the game, without the puzzles, you would not be able to play this game. Difficulty settings will be available for players who are not able to complete puzzles on the default / harder difficulty.

Adventure – As for this genre, I would like the player to experience a sense of adventure, finding new rooms, puzzles, the atmosphere should make them want to dive in more, yet the horror aspect would pull them back at the same time. A balance of this towards adventure would be a must.

Story – As for a story aspect, there would be scientist NPC’s, with one head research character that helps the player, though not willingly, as they would be angry with you for performing the summoning.

Survival Horror – The horror aspect of this game would stem from the summoning, the final puzzle within the prototype.

Sci-Fi – Along with the summoning, this also brings in a Sci-Fi aspect of the game, a whole underground scientific research facility focusing on mystical creatures, artefacts and more.
